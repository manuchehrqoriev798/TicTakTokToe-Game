## Game Logic

The game logic is meticulously implemented in JavaScript. It meticulously checks for winning combinations, examining the board's rows, columns, and diagonals. While the code is extensive with individual checks for each possible combination, there's room for optimization. Consider implementing a more efficient algorithm for checking winning conditions.

## Design and Styling

The design and styling of the game are skillfully handled through HTML and CSS. The CSS class names mentioned in the JavaScript file, such as 'won', are utilized to apply styles to the winning combinations. Feel free to further enhance the game's visual appeal by customizing the CSS to your preferences.

## How to Play

TicTacTokToe follows the traditional rules of Tic-Tac-Toe with a twist. To win, you need to connect four symbols in a row, whether it's 'X' or 'O,' and you can do this either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell. The first player to achieve a row of four symbols wins the game. To get started, open the HTML file in a web browser. Click on an empty cell to place your symbol, and the game will automatically determine the winner or declare a tie. Use the "Reset" button to start a new game.


## JavaScript Logic

The game logic is brilliantly implemented in JavaScript. It keeps track of the game state, checks for wins, and handles player moves. The logic ensures that the game adheres to the rules of connecting four symbols in a row. You can find this in the JavaScript file provided.
